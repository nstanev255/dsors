# dsors

A small discord gateway sdk. 

## tungstenite
At the heart of DSORS is the `tungstenite` package, which is used as the websocket library, which powers the client connection. \

*NOTE: If you are running on ubuntu you will need to install the `libssl-dev` and `pkg-config`, in order for the connection to happen.*
